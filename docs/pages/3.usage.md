This module exposes composables that are [auto-imported](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/docs/directory-structure/composables) by Nuxt 3.

## `useAlgolia`

By calling this composable you have access to algoliasearch anywhere in your app

```vue
<script setup>
const algolia = useAlgolia()
</script>
```

## `useSearch`

Use this composable to search the index by certain query

```vue
<script setup>
const { result, search } = useSearch('test_index') // pass your index as param

onMounted(async () => {
  await search({ query: 'Samsung' });
})
</script>
```

* `result` will contain a value of a search method. It is reactive computed property that will be populated when a search method will fulfill.
* `search` method is used to fetch the results by the index and populates `result` reactive property.
