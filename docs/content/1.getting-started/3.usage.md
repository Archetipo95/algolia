This module exposes composables that are [auto-imported](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/composables#composables-directory) by Nuxt 3.

For more details check out the official documentation of initializing algolia client [here](https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-client/getting-started/instantiate-client-index/javascript/?client=javascript)

## `useAlgoliaSearch`

Use this composable to search the index by certain query and optional request options

```vue
<script setup>
const { result, search } = useAlgoliaSearch('test_index') // pass your index name as param

onMounted(async () => {
  await search({ query: 'Samsung' });
})
</script>
```

This composable works also for SSR applications and requests like this:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
const { result, search } = useAlgoliaSearch('test_index') // pass your index name as param

const { data } = await useAsyncData('ssr-search-results', () => search({ query: 'Samsung' }))
</script>
```

* `result` will contain a value of a search method. It is reactive computed property that will be populated when a search method will fulfill. This result will have a form described [here](https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-reference/api-methods/search/#response)
* `search` method is used to fetch the results by the index and populates `result` reactive property. This method requires a parameter `query` and accepts an optional parameter of `requestOptions` that you can check out [here](https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-reference/api-methods/search/#method-param-requestoptions)

For more details check out the official documentation of this method [here](https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-client/methods/search/)

## `useAsyncAlgoliaSearch`

Async wrapper around `useAlgoliaSearch` composable that decreases the number of steps needed to use Algolia with `useAsyncData` while maintaining the same functionality. The response will have a form described [here](https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-reference/api-methods/search/#response) and will be wrapped around `useAsyncData` so you will have access to `data`, `error`, and other properties.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
const { data, error } = await useAsyncAlgoliaSearch({ indexName: 'test_index', query: 'Samsung' })
</script>

<template>
  <div>{{ data.value.hits }}</div>
</template>
```

This composable accepts an object as a param with following properties:

* `indexName` - the name of you index in Algolia dashboard. For more details about initializing index check out the official documentation [here](https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-client/getting-started/instantiate-client-index/javascript/?client=javascript#initialize-an-index). If you passed a global index in your module configuration, this property can be skipped.
* `query` - a keyword, sentence, or text that you want to search the index with.
* `key` - if you need multiple asyncAlgoliaSearch calls in a single page, add a unique key to get passed to the useAsyncData underneath, so new calls won't overwrite old data.
* `requestOptions` optional object with options for the request like filters. You can check more about is [here](https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-reference/api-methods/search/#method-param-requestoptions)

## `useAlgoliaFacetedSearch`

Use this composable to search using facet values like `category`, `phone`.

<alert type="info">

In order for this to work, you have to add facet attributes in your dashboard or via code. Read more about it [here](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/refine-results/faceting/)

</alert>

```vue
<script setup>
const { result, search } = useAlgoliaFacetedSearch('test_index')

onMounted(async () => {
  const facet = { 
    name: 'category',
    query: 'phone'
   }
  await search({ facet })
})
</script>
```

* `result` will contain a value of a search method. It is reactive computed property that will be populated when a search method will fulfill. This result will have a form described [here](https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-reference/api-methods/search-for-facet-values/#response)
* `search` method is used to fetch the results by the certain facet value pairs like name and query, and populates `result` reactive property. This method requries a parameter for `facet` and accepts an optional parameter of `requestOptions` that you can check out [here](https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-reference/api-methods/search/#method-param-requestoptions)

For more details about using this search method check out the official documentation [here](https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-reference/api-methods/search-for-facet-values/)

## `useAlgoliaRecommend`

Use this composable to get the recommendations matching certain criteria optional request options.

   ::alert{type="info"}
    In order to make this composable work, make sure to setup a `recommend` property to `true` in algolia configuration in `nuxt.config.ts`.
   ::

```vue
<script setup>
const { result, get } = useAlgoliaRecommend()

onMounted(async () => {
  await get({ queries: [{ indexName: 'test_index', model: 'related-products', objectID: 'dca44dd5-aea6-4553-a3af-fcbda981a2ef' }] });
})
</script>
```

* `result` will contain a value of a get method. It is reactive computed property that will be populated when a get method will fulfill. This result will have a form described [here](https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-reference/api-methods/get-recommendations/#response)
* `get` method is used to get the recommendations based on the criteria described [here](https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-reference/api-methods/get-recommendations/#parameters) and an optional parameter of `requestOptions` that you can check out [here](https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-reference/api-methods/search/#method-param-requestoptions)

For more details check out the official documentation of this method [here](https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-reference/api-methods/get-recommendations/)

## `useAlgoliaRef`

By calling this composable you have access to `algoliasearch` instance anywhere in your app

```vue
<script setup>
const algolia = useAlgoliaRef()
</script>
```

## `useAlgoliaInitIndex`

Use this composable to initialize index you would like to search through. It accepts an index name as a parameter

```vue
<script setup>
const algoliaIndex = useAlgoliaInitIndex('test')

console.log(algoliaIndex.appId)
</script>
```

For more details about initializing index check out the official documentation [here](https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-client/getting-started/instantiate-client-index/javascript/?client=javascript#initialize-an-index)
