## Crawler

> This section only applies if you are using Nuxt static site generation.

When setting the `crawler` option of this module (see [Setup](/getting-started/configuration#crawler)), the module will automatically collect your pages' metadata and store them in an Algolia index. This allows you to easily add a search functionality on your website or blog without worrying about updating your indices as the process happens during the Nuxt static generation.
