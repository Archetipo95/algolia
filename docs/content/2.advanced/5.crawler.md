## Crawler

> This section only applies if you are using Nuxt static site generation.
> Nuxt 3 SSG is currently under development (see [Comparison](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/getting-started/introduction#comparison))

When setting the `crawler` option of this module (see [Setup](/setup#crawler)), the module will automatically collect your pages' metadata and store them in an Algolia index. This allows you to easily add a search functionality on your website or blog without worrying about updating your indices as the process happens during the Nuxt static generation. This feature works with both Nuxt 2 and Bridge, and will support Nuxt 3 as soon as SSG is fully implemented.
